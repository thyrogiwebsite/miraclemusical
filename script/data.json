    "Blinding, shining star\nYou won't see so far\nKnow what can't be shown\nFeel what can't be known\n\nYou were an isle unto thyself\nYou had a heart you hadn't felt\nWhy would it hurt me?Or was it real?\nIt was the night we had to part\nWe were afraid to miss the start\nWhat did it matter?\nWhy would it matter?\nAnd could we heal?\n\n\nBlinding, shining star\nYou won't see so far\nKnow what can't be shown\nFeel what can't be known\n\n\nI was a victim of magic, Apollo\nCatching my breath as I bled on the ground\nSomebody called me to follow, I followed\nThinking aloud without hearing the sound\n\n\nThen, all the planets fell to dust\nLonely, departing after us\nGone, not forgotten\nLong, but forgotten old lore\nIn every element of life\nLove camouflaging under strife\nOr other matters\nMind over matters, let there be more\n\n\nMaybe you'll exit tomorrow, the sorrow\nSweeping you off as your island replies\nSudden invincible flowing a river\nClearer than all thou might view with thine eyes\n\n\nWhy did fire-erupted lands arrive?\nWhy did murderous animals survive?\nWhy did we deserve to be revived?\nWhy was any and everything alive?"
